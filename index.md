## About Me

Engineering leader with 14+ years of experience at the intersection of AI, semiconductors and systems. Currently leading ML team at Renesas Electronics, where I nurture a global team that drives cloud-native AI product innovation. Past roles at Micron, SanDisk, and Bosch shaped my expertise in edge AI, automotive systems, and advanced semiconductor solutions.

Recognized inventor with 24 U.S. patents, I thrive on turning complex technology into data-driven stories, intuitive product demos, and customer value. Equally comfortable partnering with engineers, executives, or customers, I bridge product strategy with engineering execution.

I believe engineering success rests on three pillars: People, Product, and Traction. My growth has been accelerated by many wonderful mentors, and I pay it forward by mentoring interns and early-career professionals.

Community Volunteering:
- Active K-12 STEM volunteer and hackathon mentor
- Maker at heart — experimenting with robotics, IoT, 3D printing, and AI art
